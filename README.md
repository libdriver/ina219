## LibDriver INA219

[![MISRA](https://img.shields.io/badge/misra-compliant-brightgreen.svg)](/misra/README.md) [![API](https://img.shields.io/badge/api-reference-blue.svg)](https://www.libdriver.com/docs/ina219/index.html) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg)](/LICENSE)

The INA219 is a current shunt and power monitor with an I2C- or SMBUS-compatible interface. The device monitors both shunt voltage drop and bus supply voltage, with programmable conversion times and filtering. A programmable calibration value, combined with an internal multiplier, enables direct readouts of current in amperes. An additional multiplying register calculates power in watts. The I2C- or SMBUS-compatible interface features 16 programmable addresses.The INA219 senses across shunts on buses that can vary from 0 to 26 V. The device uses a single 3- to 5.5-V supply, drawing a maximum of 1 mA of supply current.This chip can be used in servers,telecom equipment,notebook computers,power management,battery chargers,welding equipment,power supplies,test equipment and so on.

LibDriver INA219 is a full-featured driver of INA219 launched by LibDriver.It provides continuous mode reading, single mode reading, current acquisition, voltage acquisition and power acquisition.LibDriver is MISRA compliant.

### Instruction

/src includes LibDriver INA219 source files.

/interface includes LibDriver INA219 IIC platform independent template.

/test includes LibDriver INA219 driver test code and this code can test the chip necessary function simply.

/example includes LibDriver INA219 sample code.

/doc includes LibDriver INA219 offline document.

/datasheet includes INA219 datasheet.

/project includes the common Linux and MCU development board sample code. All projects use the shell script to debug the driver and the detail instruction can be found in each project's README.md.

/misra includes the LibDriver MISRA code scanning results.

### Install

Reference /interface IIC platform independent template and finish your platform IIC driver.

Add the /src directory, the interface driver for your platform, and your own drivers to your project, if you want to use the default example drivers, add the /example directory to your project.

### Usage

You can refer to the examples in the /example directory to complete your own driver. If you want to use the default programming examples, here's how to use them.

#### example basic

```C
#include "driver_ina219_basic.h"

uint8_t res;

res = ina219_basic_init(INA219_ADDRESS_0, 0.1);
if (res != 0)
{
    return 1;
}

...

for (i = 0; i < times; i++)
{
    float mV;
    float mA;
    float mW;

    res = ina219_basic_read(&mV, &mA, &mW);
    if (res != 0)
    {
        (void)ina219_basic_deinit();

        return 1;
    }

    ina219_interface_debug_print("ina219: %d/%d.\n", i + 1, times);
    ina219_interface_debug_print("ina219: bus voltage is %0.3fmV.\n", mV);
    ina219_interface_debug_print("ina219: current is %0.3fmA.\n", mA);
    ina219_interface_debug_print("ina219: power is %0.3fmW.\n", mW);
    ina219_interface_delay_ms(1000);
    
    ...
}

...

(void)ina219_basic_deinit();

return 0;
```

#### example shot

```C
#include "driver_ina219_shot.h"

uint8_t res;

res = ina219_shot_init(INA219_ADDRESS_0, 0.1);
if (res != 0)
{
    return 1;
}

...

for (i = 0; i < times; i++)
{
    float mV;
    float mA;
    float mW;

    res = ina219_shot_read(&mV, &mA, &mW);
    if (res != 0)
    {
        (void)ina219_shot_deinit();

        return 1;
    }

    ina219_interface_debug_print("ina219: %d/%d.\n", i + 1, times);
    ina219_interface_debug_print("ina219: bus voltage is %0.3fmV.\n", mV);
    ina219_interface_debug_print("ina219: current is %0.3fmA.\n", mA);
    ina219_interface_debug_print("ina219: power is %0.3fmW.\n", mW);
    ina219_interface_delay_ms(1000);
    
    ...
}

...

(void)ina219_shot_deinit();

return 0;
```
